IDE: Pycharm using Python 3.9

Included libraries: random, tnkinter, password, json

Flow of execution: Once ran the user can start by looking up a pre-existing password within the application
i.e. Amazon/Facebook. This will pull the corosponding user/email and password form the existing JSON file.
When implementing a new password, the user must fill out all fields including the website, emai/user, and password, which
can be user input or generated itself. Once the data has been saved, it writes to the JSON file and can now be called
back via the website lookup.

Issues: Thus far there are no issues, as this was a base code implementation for our project.
